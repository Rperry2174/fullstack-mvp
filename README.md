Pixel-image saver
Use this app to draw an images to use as training images for machine or for creating pixelated sprites (like old-school Mario)

This is a product intended to make creating and saving pixel-rooted images so that they can be used in applications such as machine learning or for making old-school videogame character sprite sheets.

The Problem:
Many programs online that use pictures find it easier to use, analyze, or store data in a form that is memory-inexpensive. As opposed to holding an actual image, its easier to for programs or databases to store an array of pixel values.

The Soulution:
This product will remedy this by allowing one to choose a size of image and toggle pixel values on and off. Once he or she is done creating their image they can then not only easily access that images array of pixel values to be pasted into other applications, but also be able to access past images they have drawn so that they can alter them or use them as a template to create new images.
